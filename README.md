## Purpose

The purpose of this Portfolio will be to record all my work performed while taking part in the University of Arizona's Bootcamp. This will be updated as I submit projects while taking the course, and will include some personal projects as well if I decide to take on that task.

## What I've Learned

I've learned a few things during this project as well as become more well versed with the code.

- Being able to set variables saved a lot of time when going back and forth with matching colors, I ended up adding that halfway through since I had forgotten.
- I had a lot of trouble setting up my repository, so having to do it again made me relearn it, but now I believe I have it down
- Being able to make images redirect to another website was something I didn't know how to do, or didn't have practice with, but through this project I was able to figure that out.
